## Install RsyncOSX

Index of [RsyncOSX documentation](https://rsyncosx.github.io/Documentation/).

RsyncOSX is a GUI for the rsync command-line tool. The main uses are:

- **backup** (and restore) of local files on Mac to **remote servers** connected to **Internet** or **local network**
	- the above is why I wrote RsyncOSX to use myself
- backup (and restore) local files on Mac to local storage (attached disks)
	- if this is *the only use* there might be *other tools* more useful than RsyncOSX

## YouTube video

I have uploaded a short (about 5 minutes) [YouTube video of RsyncOSX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty1r7yvgExo) : "Downloading RsyncOSX, installing, first time configuration and using RsyncOSX for the first time. Backup (as demo) of about 120 MB of data and 4000 files to a VirtualBox FreeBSD machine."

## Passwordless logins and remote servers

Backup to *remote servers* require *ssh passwordless* logins by utilizing ssh-keygen to create a ssh private and public key pair. RsyncOSX can assist in setting up [passwordless](ssh.md) logins or use the instructions in [setup passwordless logins](PasswordlessLogin.md).

## Idea behind RsyncOSX

I have two MacBooks, one is used primarily at work and the other is my private. Data is backed up to server (NAS) at home and to one offsite servers. Both MacBooks and all backup locations are kept in sync. I am using my private MacBook for Pictures (I have about 100 GB of raw picture files). Whenever I have added new picture files or done some work on pictures, changes are backup up on all servers and then restored on my MacBook used at work. The rsync command-line tool is one of the best tools around for backup and synchronizing storage. A GUI on top of rsync might hide all the details about parameters to rsync and make rsync execute the correct actions.

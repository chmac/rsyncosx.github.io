Before installing and using RsyncOSX there are some important information to read and understand. The (1) document is how to get and install RsyncOSX. The (2) document is some information what RsyncOSX is and how to use the application. Please read the (2) document before using RsyncOSX.

 - (1) getting and installing [RsyncOSX](/Install)
 - (2) important [information](/HowtoUseRsyncOSX) about what RsyncOSX is

Rsync is a file-based synchronization and backup tool. There is no custom solution for the backup archive. You can quit utilizing RsyncOSX (and rsync) at any time and still have access to all synchronized files. Be sure you understand the basics how rsync works before using RsyncOSX (and rsync).

Also see the notes about how the user [documentation](/AboutTheUserDoc) is built.

#### Changelog RsyncOSX

Please see the the [Changelog](/Changelog) for details about releases.

The following are documents about using RsyncOSX:
- a short [intro](/Intro) to RsyncOSX
- [adding configurations](/AddConfigurations) (backup and restore)
- executing [single tasks](/SingleTask) (configurations)
- executing [batch tasks](/BatchTask)
- utilizing the [snapshot feature](/Snapshots)

- some info about [logging](/Logging) execution of tasks
- some info about [user configuration](/UserConfiguration)

### Passwordless logins

Using RsyncOSX for backup to remote servers require to setup ssh passwordless login. What is ssh passwordless login? By using ssh private and public pair of keys enables a more secure method to login to remote servers without password.

- or enable [passwordless logins](/PasswordlessLogin) manually

### Parameters to rsync

There are a couple of other important information about using RsyncOSX (and rsync):

- parameters to [rsync](/Parameters)
- some more info about standard [parameters to rsync](/RsyncParameters)

### Apple App Store

Why is RsyncOSX not on Apple App Store? Well, it has been. The App Store version of RsyncOSX was dropped because of restrictions executing RsyncOSX in [Apples sandbox technology](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html). Executing applications in a sandbox environment restricts RsyncOSX (rsync) from using a ssh-tunnel. Ssh is not allowed reading certificates for passwordless logins when rsync is forked from RsyncOSX. There might be a solution for it, but I dont want to spend time investigating how.

## My NAS setup

I have setup up my own [NAS](/DIYNAS). I am doing backups by using RsyncOSX and sharing out disk by AFP and SMB.

## Rsync

The default version of `rsync` in macOS is old (version 2.6.9, [protocol](https://rsync.samba.org/how-rsync-works.html) version 29). Version [2.6.9](https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/rsync-2.6.9-NEWS) was released in nov 2006. The current release of rsync is version [3.1.3](https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/rsync-3.1.3-NEWS) protocol 31 released 28 January 2018. There are at least three options to get and install the current version of rsync for use in RsyncOSX:

- get `rsync-3.1.3.dmg` from [releases](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/releases) to install the latest version of rsync
- install Xcode and download the rsync [source](https://rsync.samba.org/) from rsync.samba.org
	- required tools are `gcc` and `make` which are part of Xcode command line tool (you might be able to install Xcode command line tool only by downloading the tools from [Apple Developer page](https://developer.apple.com/))
	- untar the [source archive](https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/) and use `make` to compile and install, rsync compiles without any issues on macOS
- install [homebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(package_management_software)) and then install rsync as part of homebrew

In RsyncOSX select [user configuration](/UserConfiguration) and set path for optional version of rsync.

## YouTube videos

There are four short YouTube videos of RsyncOSX:

- [getting](https://youtu.be/MrT8NzdF9dE) RsyncOSX and installing it
  - the video also shows how to create the two local ssh certificates for password less logins to remote server
- adding and executing the [first backup](https://youtu.be/8oe1lKgiDx8)
- doing a full [restore](https://youtu.be/-R6n_8fl6Ls) to a temporary local restore catalogs
- how to change [version of rsync](https://youtu.be/mVFL25-lo6Y) utilized by RsyncOSX

## MacUpdate and Softpedia

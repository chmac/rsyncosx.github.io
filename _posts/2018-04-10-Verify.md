To be developed.

There are some enhancements which are planned for release sometime after summer and **after** the v5.3.9.
- `--archive` vs `--checksum` parameters

The `--archive` parameter to rsync preserves a lot of attributes of files when synchronizing. When synchronizing files based upon the `--archive` parameter, rsync compares filesize and modification time to evaluate which files to be synchronized.

The `--checksum` parameters forces [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) to evaluate files based upon 128-bit [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) checksum. Rsync computes the checksum of all files and based upon the checksum, rsync finds all files which are not equal. This is a more time consuming task and it is best for verifying a backup.

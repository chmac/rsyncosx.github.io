The view is depended upon selecting a row in main view. When the view appears the size of source and remote destination is estimated.

The `--archive` parameter to rsync preserves a lot of attributes of files when synchronizing. When synchronizing files based upon the `--archive` parameter, rsync compares file size and last modification time to compute which files to be synchronized.

The `--checksum` parameters forces [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) to evaluate files based upon 128-bit [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) checksum. Rsync computes the checksum of all files and based upon the checksum, rsync finds all files which are not equal. This is a more time consuming task because rsync evaluates every file and it is best for verifying a backup.

The `Verify` button kicks off the `--checksum` process. The output is appended and refreshed every time rsync output a new line.

A verify is probably best to to do after a synchronizing is completed. If there are any files which checksums are not equal, rsync list those files. In the view above all checksums are equal and backup is verified equal to source.

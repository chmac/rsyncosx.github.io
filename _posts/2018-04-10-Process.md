In the Verify view there are two options, either do a `Verify` or a `Changed`. The `Verify` might take some time depending upon the number of files to verify. The `Changed` is quick. The tasks are aborted if the user selects another view before it is completed.

If there are many snapshots the number of remote files might be huge. In this view there are 31 snapshots with about 93,700 files.

A complete or full restore is commenced by selecting the task to restore. The rsync command shows either the `--dry-run` backup command or the restore command to execute. You might copy the command to a terminal window to check the result of a run. It is a `--dry-run` only and simulates the real run.
- the `backup` radio button shows the actual rsync command for backup task including all parameters
- the `restore` radio button shows the rsync command for restore including all parameters from the backup task

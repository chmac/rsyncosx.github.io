Detailed logging in RsyncOSX might be switched on/off in user configuration. All log records is by default listed in table within Logs view (sorted by date). Loggdata can be *filtered* by text search by selecting the appropriate column. The direction for sort is selected by direction of the arrow. Log records can be selected for delete as well. You might filter logs by date or month and then select the filtered log records for deleting.

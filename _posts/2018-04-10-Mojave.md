I have downloaded and installed the beta of macOSX 10.14 Mojave and Xcode10 beta. The desktop is set to Dark Mode and RsyncOSX compiled and executed with no changes in code. Quite exiting to check out the Dark Mode. The included rsync in 10.14 is not updated and I installed the precompiled version 3.1.3 of rsync.

I have downloaded and installed the beta of macOSX 10.14 Mojave and Xcode10 beta. All three apps are compiled with no changes in code by Xcode 10 beta on MacOS 10.13. The apps are installed on beta of macOSX 10.14 Mojave. By compiling with Xcode 10 beta they are compatible with the new Dark Mode in 10.14.

The included rsync in 10.14 is still not updated and I installed the precompiled version 3.1.3 of rsync

RsyncOSX.

I have downloaded and installed the beta of macOSX 10.14 Mojave and Xcode10 beta. The desktop is set to Dark Mode and RsyncOSX compiled and executed with no changes in code. The included rsync in 10.14 is still not updated and I installed the precompiled version 3.1.3 of rsync. The compiler produces some warnings when compiling RsyncOSX. I will probably spend more time with macOSX Mojave and Xcode 10 when Apple releases the public beta.

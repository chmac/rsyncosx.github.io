See important info about how to use [RsyncOSX and rsync](/HowtoUseRsyncOSX). There is also a short [intro](/Intro) to RsyncOSX.

## Download link and install

RsyncOSX is [released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/releases/tag/v5.5.5) in version 5.5.5 (22 October 2018). Both apps are signed with my Apple ID developer certificate and [notarized](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) by Apple. It is **not** required to install the [RsyncOSXsched.app](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSXsched). RsyncOSXsched.app is for scheduled backups only.

#### Install RsyncOSX.app and  RsyncOSXsched.app

For your own safety verify the shasums. The command `shasum ~/pathtodownload/RsyncOSX-version.dmg` will print the shasum for the .dmg file.

- shasum RsyncOSX-5.5.5.dmg: 5ebfa9249ad25e31439e619c2fa59951fc5d7c08
- shasum RsyncOSXsched-5.5.5.dmg: 9f307395ce3d3e89213eb6871cc8a433e8ab7acb

To install RsyncOSX open the downloaded `RsyncOSX-version.dmg` file, copy the RsyncOSX.app to the `/Application` catalog or any other preferred catalog. And likewise for the `RsyncOSXsched-version.dmg`

#### Version 3.1.3 of rsync

See readme.txt within dmg file for how to manually install version rsync 3.1.3.

**RsyncOSX** is installed and used at your own risk and developer accepts no responsibility for any errors, omissions or loss of data by using the application. The application is signed with my Apple Developer ID certificate.

## Passwordless logins and remote servers

Backup to **remote servers** require **ssh passwordless** logins by utilizing ssh-keygen to create a ssh private and public key pair. RsyncOSX can assist in setting up [passwordless](/ssh) logins or use the instructions in [setup passwordless logins](/PasswordlessLogin).

## YouTube videos

There are four short YouTube videos of RsyncOSX:

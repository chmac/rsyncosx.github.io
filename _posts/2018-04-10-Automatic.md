The automatic feature of RsyncOSX is triggered by `âŒ˜B` shortcut. RsyncOSX executes a `--dry-run` task for all configurations and execute a backup run for all tasks with data to be transferred or files to be deleted.

The automatic backup can be aborted at any time. The tasks to be executed is equal to tasks selected by [quick backup](/Quickbackup).

Before using this feature check it out by using the quick backup. The `Select` button in quick backup selects the tasks which is automatically selected and executed.

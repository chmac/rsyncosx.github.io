The automatic feature of RsyncOSX is triggered by `âŒ˜B` shortcut. RsyncOSX executes a `--dry-run` task for all configurations and execute a backup run for all tasks with data to be transferred. The automatic backup can be aborted at any time. The tasks to be executed is equal to tasks selected by [quick backup](/Quickbackup).

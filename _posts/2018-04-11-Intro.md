This page is a short intro to RsyncOSX. For more details about the various functions of RsyncOSX please see the documentation about each function. Also be sure you understand  [the basics](/HowtoUseRsyncOSX)  about how rsync works before using RsyncOSX and rsync.

All configurations to execute are listed in table. From the Execute view most actions (edit configurations, adding parameters to rsync, delete configurations) regarding configurations are executed.

Configurations can be saved in user selected **profiles**. The profile in use is shown in label `Profile: profilname`. Information about **new or delete** files and **numbers remote** of directories are only available if version 3.x of rsync is used.

How to start? You can get up and running in just a few clicks.

Open RsyncOSX and select the `Add` tab.

In the `Add` tab, as an example, add the Documents catalog as source and the tmp catalog as remote. This will copy all content of Documents to the tmp catalog. The tmp catalog can also be an attached disk. Use drag and drop from Finder.

## Type of tasks

There are **three** types of how to synchronize source and destination (backup):

(1) **synchronize** source and backup location, any changed and deleted files in backup location will either be overwritten or deleted
  - this is the standard synchronize task in RsyncOSX, after execution source and destination (backup) is 100% in sync if there are no `--exclude` parameters to rsync
  - an `--exclude` parameter instructs rsync to disregard files, catalogs and patterns included in the parameter

(2) **synchronize** and **save changed** and **deleted** files in a separate backup catalog by adding a [parameters](/Parameters) to rsync

(3) **snapshot**  tasks, a [snapshot](/Snapshots) of previous synchronize task is stored before a new task is executed, number of snapshots are user defined, copy deleted or previous versions of files from snapshots


## How to execute any of the three type of tasks

There are **seven** ways to execute a task. And all tasks can be **aborted** at any time.

First select **one** task in Execute view, applies to (1) and (2) below.

(1) single task, a **double click** on a task executes first a test run (`--dry-run`), the next double click executes the real run

- see [single task](/SingleTask) for more info

(2) `⌘R` (execute one task now) - shortcut for immediate execute **one selected** task
- selected task is executed in one go
- if a task is executed by shortcut `⌘R`, a select of another task during execution will terminate (abort) the current task

(3) `⌘B` (execute all tasks now) - shortcut for **automatic executing** backups or by select the **double arrow**, the command automatically checks all tasks for files to be synchronized or deleted and automatically executes all tasks with files to be synchronized

- see [automatic backups](/Automatic) for more info

(4) quick backup, select either of the marked arrow buttons in menu bar

![](/images/RsyncOSX/master/intro/menu3.png)

- start with dynamic view of local vs remote storage, selecting tasks to execute automatically opens the quick backup menu with preselected tasks
- select which tasks to execute in one go, selection is not saved
- see [quick backup](/Quickbackup) for more info

(5) mark backup tasks for **batch**, select the **single arrow** button executes all tasks marked for batch in one go

![](/images/RsyncOSX/master/intro/menu4.png)

- tasks which are marked for batch are selected
- see [batch task](/BatchTask) for more info

(6) **schedule** a task, scheduled tasks are executed according to date and time, either once, daily or weekly

- see [scheduled backups](/ScheduleTasks) and [menu app](/Menuapp) for more info

(7) by combining `rclone` and `rsync` enable **encrypted backups** to remote servers

- see [encrypted](/Encrypted) backups for more info

## YouTube videos

There are four short YouTube videos of RsyncOSX:

- [getting](https://youtu.be/MrT8NzdF9dE) RsyncOSX and installing it
  - the video also shows how to create the two local ssh certificates for password less logins to remote server
- adding and executing the [first backup](https://youtu.be/8oe1lKgiDx8)
- doing a full [restore](https://youtu.be/-R6n_8fl6Ls) to a temporary local restore catalogs
- how to change [version of rsync](https://youtu.be/mVFL25-lo6Y) utilized by RsyncOSX

This page is a short intro to RsyncoSX and a brief walkthrough of the main functions of RsyncOSX. Some of the screenshots are previous versions. For more details about the various functions of RsyncOSX please see the documentation about each function. Be sure you understand the basics about how rsync works before using RsyncOSX (and rsync).

All configurations to execute are listed in table. From the main view most actions (edit configurations, adding parameters to rsync, delete configurations) regarding configurations are executed. Configurations can be saved in user selected **profiles**. The **profile** in use is shown in label `Profile: name`. **Information** about *new:*, *delete:* files and *remote number* of directories are only available if version 3.x of rsync is used.

There are link to four short videos of RsyncOSX in bottom of this page. It all starts with [adding a configuration](/AddConfigurations).

## Type of tasks

There are **three** types of how to synchronize source and destination (backup):

(1) **synchronize** source and backup location, any changed and deleted files in backup location will either be overwritten or deleted
  - this is the standard synchronize task in RsyncOSX, after execution source and destination (backup) is 100% in sync if there are no `--exclude` parameters to rsync
  - an `--exclude` parameter instructs rsync to disregard files, catalogs and patterns included in the parameter

(2) **synchronize** and **save changed** and **deleted** files in a separate backup catalog by adding a [parameters](/Parameters) to rsync

(3) **snapshot**  tasks, a [snapshot](/Snapshots) of previous synchronize task is stored before a new task is executed, number of snapshots are user defined, copy deleted or previous versions of files from snapshots


## How to execute any of the three type of tasks

There are **seven** ways to execute a task. And all tasks can be aborted at any time.

![](/images/RsyncOSX/master/abort.png)

First select **one** task in main view. applies to (1) and (2) below.

(1) single task, a **double click** on a task executes first a test run (`--dry-run`), the next double click executes the real run

See [single task](/SingleTask) for more info.

(2) `⌘R` (execute one task now) - shortcut for immediate execute **one selected** task
- selected task is executed in one go
- if a task is executed by shortcut `⌘R`, a select of another task during execution will terminate (abort) the current task

(3) `⌘B` (execute all tasks now) - shortcut for **automatic executing** backups, the command automatically checks all tasks for files to be synchronized or deleted and automatically executes all tasks with files to be synchronized

See [automatic backups](/Automatic) for more info.

(4) quick backup, either select the **i** or **double arrow** button in menu bar

![](/images/RsyncOSX/master/quickbar.png)

  - select which tasks to execute in one go, selection is not saved
  - start with dynamic view of local vs remote storage, selecting tasks to execute automatically opens the quick backup menu with preselected tasks

See [quick backup](/Quickbackup) for more info.

(5) mark backup tasks for **batch**, select the **single arrow** button executes all tasks marked for batch in one go

![](/images/RsyncOSX/master/batchbar.png)

- tasks which are marked for batch are selected

See [batch task](/BatchTask) for more info.

(6) **schedule** a task, scheduled tasks are executed according to date and time, either once, daily or weekly

See [scheduled backups](/ScheduleTasks) and [menu app](/Menuapp) for more info.

(7) by combining `rclone` and `rsync` enable **encrypted backups** to remote servers

See [encrypted](/Encrypted) backups for more info.

## Restore files

Files and catalogs can be restored by using the [copy single files](/CopySingleFiles) or by executing a full [restore](/Fullrestore).

## Info about tasks

See info about [caching](/Caching) of information.

## Logging

RsyncOSX is logging all tasks. The user can choose in user configuration, to disable or enable detailed logging. Detailed logging is on as default. In log view all tasks with date, number of files and size transferred is logged. In the main view only date and time for last execution is set.
![Schedule](/images/RsyncOSX/master/logging/log1.png)
See [logging](/Logging) for more info.

## Check remote servers

The <span style="color:red">red tasks</span> indicates no connection to remote server. Selecting the TCP-button executes the check and marks configurations not available (no contact with remote server) red. RsyncOSX does a **background** check (informal only) for remote servers. The server `freenas.local` is a local NAS server (FreeNAS) and RsyncOSX does not find `freenas.local` outside my home and marks configurations red in table view.

## Ssh

Setting up password less logins is required to backup files to remote servers. RsyncoSX can assist in setting up password less logins.
![Main view](/images/RsyncOSX/master/ssh/ssh.png)
See [ssh](/ssh) for more info.

## Rsync errors

Sometimes rsync throws errors. RsyncOSX does a simple check in output if there are any occurrence of the words `rsync error:`. If found RsyncOSX resets the work queue. This is *not* an advanced error handling.

## User configurations

Some configurations can be set on or off by the user.
![](/images/RsyncOSX/master/userconfig/user.png)
See [user configuration](/UserConfiguration) for more info.

## Rsync parameters

The user can pass any parameter to rsync or choose some predefined parameters.
![Main view](/images/RsyncOSX/master/rsyncparameters.png)
See [rsync parameters](/Parameters) for more info about user selected parameters and [default parameters](/RsyncParameters) about default parameters.

## Profiles

RsyncOSX uses profiles. If not used all configurations are saved in the default profile. Which profile in use is labeled on left top of table.

**Double click** on a profile name to select a profile.

In the profiles menu there are two options:

- `OK`. Name of new profile must be set in `New profile name` before `OK` button is selected. If `New profile name` is empty the view is closed (not loading a new profile).
- `Delete` profile. Select profile to be deleted in list of profiles and select `Delete` button to delete.
- `Default` button selects the default profile.

## RsyncOSX configuration files

RsyncOSX configuration file, scheduled tasks which also includes log records and user configuration are plain XML-files ([property list files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list)). Files are saved in:

- `~/Documents/Rsync/MacID/configRsync.plist` - configurations
  - `~/` is user home directory
  - `MacID` is the Mac serial number and is automatically set by RsyncOSX
- `~/Documents/Rsync/MacID/scheduleRsync.plist` - scheduled tasks including log records
- `~/Documents/Rsync/MacID/config.plist` - user config

If _profile_ is used:

- `~/Documents/Rsync/MacID/profile/configRsync.plist`
- `~/Documents/Rsync/MacID/profile/scheduleRsync.plist`
  - `profile` is the profile name
- `~/Documents/Rsync/MacID/config.plist` - user config

## YouTube videos

There are four short YouTube videos of RsyncOSX:

- [getting](https://youtu.be/MrT8NzdF9dE) RsyncOSX and installing it
  - the video also shows how to create the two local ssh certificates for password less logins to remote server
- adding and executing the [first backup](https://youtu.be/8oe1lKgiDx8)
- doing a full [restore](https://youtu.be/-R6n_8fl6Ls) to a temporary local restore catalogs
- how to change [version of rsync](https://youtu.be/mVFL25-lo6Y) utilized by RsyncOSX

All tasks marked for batch is presented in screen for batchtask. Choosing `Execute` executes all tasks in **one go**, both the **estimation** and **real run**. The screen is updated as the process of execution is going forward.

Selecting the `Abort` button (the `Close` button becomes `Abort` button when Execution is selected) aborts any remaining tasks.

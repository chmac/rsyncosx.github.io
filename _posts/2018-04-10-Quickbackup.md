There are two options for executing quick backups, either go via the i-button or directly to quickbackup. The best way is to go via the i-button. By selecting the tasks for quickbackup within the information view (i-button), RsyncOSX picks up the estimation and uses the numbers to indicate the progress of backup.

In the information view `Select` tasks to backup and press play button. RsyncOSX automatically opens the quick backup view and commence the backup tasks.

If there is only files to be deleted no backup is selected.

There are two options for executing quick backups, either estimate and select or directly to quickbackup. In either way RsyncOSX picks up the estimation and uses the numbers to indicate the progress of backup.

Do an estimate and select first.

Go ahead and do the backup. If this is selected RsyncOSX automatically picks the tasks and executes the selected tasks.

The quickbackup executes a estimation run and selects all tasks with files to be synchronized. To commence the actual synchronizing select the marked play button.

### About me

My name is Thomas and I am the developer of RsyncOSX. The development of RsyncOSX commenced in January 2016 as a project to learn Swift. And I have learned a lot. The codebase for RsyncOSX today is very different from the very start. There has been some refactor of code and the status of codebase today is quite stable. I have a university degree in computing science, but I am not a professional developer.

A professional Swift developer would probably written the code somewhat different. To be a professional developer require, in my opinion, to be a full time developer. There are a few design patterns around but there is no such thing as a *silver bullet*. To be really good at adapting a pattern require, again in my opinion, a role as professional developer. In such a context I am only an amateur.

I will continue to improve, enhance and add new functions in RsyncOSX. It is fun to code and I would like all users of RsyncOSX to ask for new functions. Testing is also a challenge and I am not able to test all parts in RsyncOSX ahead of new releases.
